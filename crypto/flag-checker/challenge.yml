flags:
  # The flag should match this pattern: ^CyberErudites{[A-Za-z0-9_@><:\.\-\+\$#!]{12,}}$
  # 1. It can have any alphanumeric characters in addition of the following
  #    special characters (separated by comma): _, @, >, <, :, ., -, +, $, #, !
  # 2. The string inside the flag format should be at least 12 characters long and
  #    hard to guess.

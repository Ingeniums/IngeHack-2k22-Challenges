# IP Theft

**`Author:`** [Fa2y](https://github.com/Fa2y)

## Description

Hello, we believe we suffered from a breach as we found our latest IP is being sold on the darkweb.
After an internal investegation was launched, an employee says that he plugged an usb that he found laying in the parking lot, luckily he still has it. Our security team couldn't figure it out what it does as it didn't mount or showed in the drives but we have dumped the content for the SDcard inside of it.
Please check it out and figure out what exactly did they steal and how.

description: "> Hello, we believe we suffered from a breach as we found  \n> our latest\
  \ IP is being sold on the darkweb.  \n> After an internal investegation was launched,\
  \ an employee says  \n> that he plugged an usb that he found laying in the parking\
  \ lot,  \n> luckily he still has it. Our security team couldn't figure out  \n>\
  \ what it does as it didn't mount but we have dumped the content  \n> for the SDcard\
  \ inside of it.  \n> Please check it out and figure out what exactly did they steal\
  \ and how.  \n> USB Picture: https://imgur.com/a/dkUHKta  \n\n**Author** : Fa2y\n"
